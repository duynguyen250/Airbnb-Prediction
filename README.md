# Airbnb-Prediction


This is my final project for my Machine Learning classes which uses Boston's Airbnb data from Inside Airbnb to make prediction on price and superhost status. 

Link to dataset: https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/ 
Note: The dataset used in this project was from June 2024.

Please see the report named [Report.pdf](https://github.com/duynguyen250/Airbnb-Prediction/blob/main/Report.pdf) for a detailed explanation of each processes of the project. The code is in a Rmarkdown file called [Airbnb.Rmd](https://github.com/duynguyen250/Airbnb-Prediction/blob/main/Airbnb.Rmd).
